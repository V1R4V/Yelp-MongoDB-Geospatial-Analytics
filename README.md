# Yelp Business Analytics with MongoDB

Loads a Yelp business dataset into MongoDB and analyzes it with the MongoDB Query Language: filters and projections, aggregation pipelines, cross-collection joins, and geospatial queries that are plotted on maps of Santa Barbara, CA.

## Highlights

- **Ingestion**: newline-delimited JSON goes into four collections: `businesses`, `reviews`, `tips`, `users`.
- **Querying**: filters on city, star rating, category (regex), postal code, and nested attributes such as wheelchair accessibility, with projections, sorting, and limits.
- **Aggregation pipelines**: `$match`, `$group`, `$split`, `$unwind`, and `$sort` produce category-level counts, average ratings, and user-activity metrics (distinct businesses reviewed, total reviews).
- **Joins**: `$lookup` combines businesses with their reviews to summarize positive vs. negative review volume per business.
- **Geospatial**: a `2dsphere` index backs three map queries:
  - `$geoWithin` against the Santa Barbara city boundary (GeoJSON polygon)
  - `$near` the Stearns Wharf pier
  - `$centerSphere` around Santa Barbara Airport
